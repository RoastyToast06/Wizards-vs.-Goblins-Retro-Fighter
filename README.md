# Wizards vs. Goblins
This game features an 8-bit game of wizards facing goblins using magical spells! This project was designed for my Data Structures & Algorithms course.

## Project Details
This project was coded entirely in C#, but my teaching assistant designed the renderer for the class (Data Structures & Algorithms). The game implementation utilizes ArrayLists to manage all entities and update all interactions and features.
